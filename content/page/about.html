            I started my journey in high-school with a voluntary course on the basics of web development. That was in 5th grade when I was 11 years old. Our teacher handed me a pdf with the basic lines of html and css and I just randomly started typing them into the windows notepad. And that's how it all started.

            During the last five years, I spent many long nights at my desk trying to figure out how things work. It started with simple and ugly websites. Over the time, I also got really interested in the topic of design, especially the user-experience part.
